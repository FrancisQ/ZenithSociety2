### Notes on DateTimePicker Bootstrap widget and DateTime IN GENERAL.
- Install bootstrap datetimepicker via BOWER (Nuget doesn't work with Core)
- The glyph icon will ALWAYS float to the right and the input to the left. Therefore parent must be small enough so they don't separate.
- Make sure you add type="datetime" for the input OR in the model.
- Make sure model format (specified in the model file) is ALWAYS in the MM/DD/YYYY ... format (local format, so just ensure month is before date).
- Make sure input format (specified in a custom JS file) is ALWAYS in the MM/DD/YYYY ... format (local format, so just ensure month is before date). 
	This is so the controller can properly bind or retrieve the values from the view. 



### Sample usage of DateTimePicker widget
// custom prefix means you have to declare it yourself (not part of bootstrap, jQuery, etc.)

--- View.cshtml ---
<div class='col-md-10 custom-width-limiter'>
	<div class='input-group date custom-datetimepicker'>
        <input asp-for="FromDate" type="datetime" class="form-control" placeholder="M/D/YYYY HH:MM AM" />
        <span class="input-group-addon">
			<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-calendar"></span>
		</span>
	</div>
</div>

--- wwwroot/css/site.css ---
/* Set widths on the form inputs since otherwise they're 100% wide */
input,
select,
textarea {
    max-width: 280px;  
}
/* Helper for datetimepicker, or the icon will stick to the right */
.input-width-limiter {
    max-width: 310px; /* Because of padding/margins, +30px from above value */
}

--- wwwroot/js/site.js ---
$(function () {
	// Remember month must be before date, other than that you can do whatever
    $('.datetimepicker').datetimepicker({
        format: 'M/D/YYYY h:mm A'
    });
});
